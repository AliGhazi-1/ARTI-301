1. Problem Type
This project is a Supervised Learning task, specifically a Binary Classification problem.
•	Reason: The goal is to predict a discrete outcome with only two possible categories: whether a customer will "Stay" or "Leave" (Churn).
2. Target Variable
The target variable in this dataset is the Churn column.
•	This is the label that the model will try to predict for each customer.
3. Model Objective
The model is expected to learn the patterns from customer features such as contract type, monthly charges, and tenure to predict the probability of a customer canceling their service.
4. Problem Description
"In the telecommunications industry, customer 'Churn' (when a customer stops using a service) is a major challenge because it is more expensive to acquire new customers than to keep existing ones.
The goal of this project is to use Machine Learning to analyze the 'Telco Customer Churn' dataset. By building a Classification Model, we aim to identify 'at-risk' customers who are likely to leave. If the model predicts these customers correctly, the company can take action like offering discounts or better service plans to encourage them to stay, which helps the business reduce financial losses and maintain its customer base."
